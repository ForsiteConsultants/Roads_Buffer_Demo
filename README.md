# Roads_Buffer_Demo
# Road Buffer Processing Script

This script processes a roads dataset in an ArcGIS geodatabase by buffering roads based on their class and type.

## Functionality

1. **Sets the workspace**  
   - Defines the working environment as `"C:\GIS\Projects\RoadBuffer.gdb"`, ensuring all operations occur within this geodatabase.

2. **Defines input and output data**  
   - `input_roads`: The roads feature class containing attributes `ROAD_CLASS` and `ROAD_TYPE`.  
   - `output_buffer_fc`: The feature class where buffered roads will be stored.  
   - If the output feature class doesnâ€™t exist, it is created as a polygon feature class.

3. **Extracts unique road classifications**  
   - Uses a `SearchCursor` to retrieve all unique combinations of `ROAD_CLASS` and `ROAD_TYPE` from the input dataset.

4. **Loops through each unique road class and type**  
   - Filters roads that match the current `ROAD_CLASS` and `ROAD_TYPE`.  
   - Selects these roads using `SelectLayerByAttribute`.  
   - Buffers the selected roads using the `BUFFER` field (assumed to store buffer distances).  
   - Appends the buffered features into the final `Roads_Buffered` dataset.  
   - Deletes temporary buffer layers to clean up.

5. **Prints completion message**  
   - Indicates that the buffer process has finished.

## Purpose

This script systematically applies a buffer to roads based on their classification, merging results into a final feature class for further spatial analysis or visualization.
